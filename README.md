# Instacart Analysis on Python ![image](https://github.com/Bandana2024/Intacart_Python/assets/157310378/d933e6e3-c413-4a8f-af3d-8f3203b8038a)



## Project Overview
Instacart, an established online grocery store with a mobile app platform, the objective is to conduct an initial data and exploratory analysis. Despite Instacart's commendable sales performance, there is a need to gain deeper insights into sales patterns. The assignment involves leveraging analytical techniques to examine specific datasets, derive meaningful insights, and propose data-driven strategies for enhanced segmentation aligned with predefined criteria.
## Key questions
 - The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
 day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
 times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
 spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
 these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
 use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
 - Aretherecertain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
 and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
 product orders.
 ## Data
Data sources are open-source data sets from Instacart, but additional data such as customer data set was created and included for the purpose of the project)
 - Produsts Data set
 - Customer Data set
 - Orders Data set
 - Orders_produts_prior
## Tools
- Ananconda(Jupyter notebook)
- Pandas: for data analyzation
- Seaborn: for data visualization
- Matplotlib: for data visualization
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
